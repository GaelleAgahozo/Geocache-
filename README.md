# Geocaching App

## What does our app do?

Our app allows the user to locate geographic points of interest from a list of provided locations, andprovides direction to target locations using a compass.

It is both fun and intreseting. It can help you relax as you move around campus trying to find target locations. 

## How does our app work?

When you open/run our app, it takes you straight to our home screen. Our home screen has a list of different location on the Hendrix college campus and allows the user to click on a direction of their choice.

As shown on the screenshot, any location ;ist item has two components: a name and the latitude and longitude below it.

When the user clicks on any location list item, the app takes you to the Compass Screen which has an arrow that points to the target location and displays the distance between the user's current location and target location. When the user starts moving, their position gets updated and the distance between them and the target location is updated as well.

When the user gets to their destination, the distance between them and the target location will be zero and their position will be updated to be the same as the target destination as shown below

## Who is the audience for our project?

This app is for anyone who is interested in exploring different places based on their geographic coordinates. Currently, it only has locations that are found on the Hendrix College campus but can be expanded to incorporate other locations.
